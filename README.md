--------CODE BASE----------
this app was built using FLUTTER/DART as the code base. is works majorly using Widgets as the building block

 ------------DESIGN-------------------
 - COLUMN : this widget helps in arranging items (text, pictures, icon etc) in the vertical axis that is
 one on top the other

 - CIRCLEAVATAR : this widget helped to insert a picture into a circle

 - SAFEAREA : it helped in constraining the entire body of the app (that is other component of the app) within
 a sufficient padding to prevent obstruction by the operating system and other programs

 -SIZEDBOX : this design widget helped in creating a space between two component design widget

 -DIVIDER : this widget helped in creating a horizontal line whose width can resized to any value
